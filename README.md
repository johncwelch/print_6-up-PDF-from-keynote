Print a keynote file as a 6-up PDF

This script creates a 6-up pdf file from a keynote file. In theory this should be simple. Bit of keynot scripting, bit of UI scripting, bob's your uncle.

In reality, Keynote's accessibility is a gods-damned mess. It is shameful how bad it is. UI elements with no name. Lots of them. No really, read the script and the comments, you'll see. It works, but dear god.

Whoever is in charge of accessibility for Keynote really dropped the ball here. *hard*
